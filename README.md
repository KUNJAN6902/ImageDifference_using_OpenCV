# ImageDifference_using_OpenCV

I implemented "Image Difference with OpenCV and Python" of PyImageSearch by Adrian Rosebrock.

My intention to work on this exercise is to understand OpenCV and Image Processing.

In order to compute the difference between two images, Structural Similarity Index has been used.
And, Later code is written to determine exactly where, in terms of (x, y)-coordinate location, the image differences are.

This exercise is done using Python, OpenCV, Scikit-image, and imutils.
